# DES-Encryption

Functions utilised by both the Encryptor and Decryptor stored in functions.cpp

DES encryption function in DES.cpp 

# To-Do

Increase efficiency of functions like leftshift
and remove the necessity for converting integers to binary array representations by utilising bit manipulation

Add functionality for AES and other encryption algorithms

# Usage 

Encryption/Decryption [cbc] [pcbc] [cfb] [ofb]

Program will ask for 8byte key and IV and file for input

for encryption a plaintext txt is required for input 

for decryption a hex file is required (encryption outputs hex)
